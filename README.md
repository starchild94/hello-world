# hello-world
first git hub practice repository
01 June 2017

Hello my name is Brian Montenegro and I am currently a student at UConn Storrs branch campus. This is my first time using github and i cannot wait to create and collaborate on projects to further enhance my coding and git hub skills/understanding.

A brief description of my background. I come from a big family with six siblings. I am the seventh and youndgest child. I have worked since I was sixteen years old in jobs that range from grocery stores, bus boy at a restaurant, bar back, waiter, a mathematics tutor for Norwalk Community College, a java programming language tutor for Norwalk Community College, an IT shop technician for UConn Storrs UTIS Husky Tech and I also worked on user services for Husky Tech. 

I started community college a year late. High school was a bad experience for me and I was not a good student. In fact I barely graduated with a 1.9 gpa! I wanted to ensure that college was the right move for me take. I knew that I would not get any financial help from my family and my single mother. Despite that fact I reinvented myself and payed through community college from working and with some help from the government. I knew my taxes were paying for something! It took three years to graduate community college and I ended up with a 3.1 overall gpa in computer science. Other school feats were that I established the Norwalk Community College Computer Science Club CSC for shor. Through the club I was able to acquire an internship with Inovative Network Solutions Corporation, an IT company in Stamford.

NCC sparked my interest with computer science, intorducing me to my first and by far favorite language JAVA. I have not done a lot of independent projects on my own due to my other duties and responsibilities. Hopefully this will change with git hub. 

I got accepted into the University of Connecticut and just finished my first year there. What a tremendous change and challenege that was to experience. Still I am gratefull to be able to attend UConn and won't stop till I get my Bachelors degree. Computer Science at UConn is very different from Computer Science at NCC. NCC offered a more practical approach to coding, assigning us projects every week with the objective to learn how to write code, so that the coding knowledge we learned was used to create a real world application. UConn took my knowledge of Computer Science knowledge to another level. Instead of just learning how to code we needed to, as the intellectuals at the University would say, learn the concepts of Computer Science. My first year at the University I learned about various topics ranging from recursion, functional programming with scheme, object oriented programming with python, and it introduced me to some new concepts of data structures and algorithms such as graphs , BFS, DFS, and hash tables. UConn not only increased my knowledge of computer science but it also shed some light on my character as well. It taught me great time management skills.

I am currently writing this first project in the summer with hopes to further enhance my understanding of programming. I am eager to continue my journey of being a student to technology.

Thats a little bit about me. If you took the time to read all of it congrats. Please feel free to share some projects with me to work on.

Thanks!
